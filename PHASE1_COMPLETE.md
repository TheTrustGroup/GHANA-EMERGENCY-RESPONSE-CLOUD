## 🚀 Ready for Phase 2!

You're now ready to proceed to **Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup**.

### Phase 2 Overview:
1. **Choose Hosting Platform** (Vercel, AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.)
2. **Set Up Production Database** (PostgreSQL)
3. **Configure Domain & DNS**
4. **Set Up File Storage** (S3 or equivalent)
5. **Set Up Redis** (for rate limiting)

---

## 📋 Optional: Fill in API Keys

Before Phase 2, you can optionally fill in API keys in `.env.production`:

### Required for Core Functionality:
- **Mapbox Token** - For maps functionality
- **Pusher Credentials** - For real-time updates
- **Database URL** - Will be set up in Phase 2

### Can Wait Until Phase 2:
- AWS S3 credentials
- Email service credentials
- SMS service credentials
- Redis URL (will be set up in Phase 2)

**Note:** You can proceed to Phase 2 with placeholders and update them as you set up each service.

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Option 1: Proceed to Phase 2 (Recommended)
Start setting up your infrastructure:
- Choose hosting platform
- Set up production database
- Configure domain

### Option 2: Obtain API Keys First
If you prefer to have all API keys ready:
- Get Mapbox token
- Get Pusher credentials
- Set up AWS account (if using S3)

**Recommendation:** Proceed to Phase 2. You'll need the database and hosting set up anyway, and you can fill in API keys as you configure each service.
